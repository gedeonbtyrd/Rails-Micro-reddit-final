Set up a new Rails project and create the necessary models and controllers for the app.

Create a Post model with fields for the title, body, and user_id. The user_id field will be used to associate each post with its author.

Create a User model with fields for the username, email, and password. Add a has_many association between the User and Post models, so that each user can have multiple posts.


Create the necessary views and routes for the app to display the posts and allow users to create, edit, and delete posts.

Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only logged-in users can create posts.

Test the app and make any necessary changes or bug fixes.


Note that this is a high-level overview of the process and many other details such as adding validations, pagination, comments, etc needs to be taken care of.
